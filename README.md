# Toronto-Building-Permits

An Analysis of Toronto Building Permits
# Overview
Welcome to the Toronto Building Permit Analysis repo!

This project analyzes Toronto's building permit data with the aim of better understanding how the city is changing â€” where construction is happening, what kinds of projects are being approved, and how patterns of residential intensification are playing out across time and geography.

Drawing on principles from data visualization and storytelling, this repo highlights trends in the types, costs, and locations of building permits issued in the city. It uses open data, tidy R tools, and a reproducible workflow to produce insights that may be valuable for urban planners, policy analysts, and anyone interested in the evolving landscape of Toronto.



# Data
The dataset used in this project comes from the City of Toronto Open Data Portal. It includes information on building permits issued over several years, including permit type, location, estimated construction cost, number of dwellings created or removed, and more.

Due to the nature of administrative data, many permits are missing values for key variables such as construction cost or dwelling count. These missing values have been handled appropriately in the analysis, with relevant notes in the final report.

All data used in this project is stored in the data folder for transparency and reproducibility.
